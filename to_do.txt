use macro and type casting

Building a source table: stg_fhv_tripdata
Building a fact table: fact_fhv_trips

What is the count of records in the model fact_trips after running all 
models with the test run variable disabled and filtering for 2019 and 2020 data only (pickup datetime)?

staging -> type casting and prepare the data
fact -> combine the stages data (preprocessed data) together and create buisness metrics or graphs
